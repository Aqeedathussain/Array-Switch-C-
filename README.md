# 🔧 C++ Basics: Array Initialization & Switch-Case Demonstration

This repository contains two beginner-friendly C++ programs that explain **array manipulation** and **nested switch-case logic** in a clear, step-by-step way.

##  Program Overview (Step-by-Step Explanation)

### 1 **Array Initialization & Display**
- A fixed-size array is created with 10 elements.
- A loop updates each element with a constant value.
- Another loop displays each updated element to show how arrays store repeated values.
- Demonstrates the basics of:
  - Looping  
  - Array indexing  
  - Printing structured output

### 2 **Switch-Case Conditional Logic**
- A variable is evaluated using a switch-case structure.
- One case checks a numeric value, while another attempts to match a character value.
- Includes a nested switch to demonstrate multi-level decision making.
- A `default` case handles unmatched c
