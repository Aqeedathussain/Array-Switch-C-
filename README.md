## Description
This repository contains two simple C++ programs demonstrating basic programming concepts:

1. **Array Initialization and Printing** – Initializes an array of size 10 with a fixed value and prints it.  
2. **Nested Switch Statement** – Demonstrates the use of `switch` statements and nested switches with `char` and `int` types.

These programs are perfect for beginners who want to understand arrays, loops, and switch-case behavior in C++.
